# UFEDLib-py

Python port of the C# **UFEDLib** project originally created by Sönke Eilers  [(https://github.com/SEilers/UFEDLib)].

This library parses Cellebrite UFED/UFDR output files into Python dataclasses and 
provides a high-level `ReportData` object for easier access and processing of forensic report data.
